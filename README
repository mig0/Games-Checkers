Games::Checkers is a set of Perl classes implementing the Checkers game
play. Several national rule variants are supported. A basic AI heuristics is
implemented using the Minimax algorithm. Replay of previously recorded games
is supported too.

This package is intended to provide complete infrastructure for interactive
and automatic playing and manipulating of Checkers games. Some features are
not implemented yet.

See doc/rules to read about the Checkers game rules.
Alternatively see Games::Checkers man page after installing this package.
You can run perl scripts in bin/ directory without installing anything.

Currently supported board sizes:

	* 8x8
	* 10x10 (not yet, but will be soon hopefully)

Currently supported variants:

	* Russian Checkers (AI and game replay)
	* British Checkers (game replay)
	* Italian Checkers (game replay, set $ENV{ITALIAN_BOARD_NOTATION})

Currently supported game file formats:

	* .pdn files (trying to detect a lot of broken notations too)
	* .pdn.gz|xz|bz2 files (automatically uncompressed on the fly)

Currently installed scripts:

	* pcheckers-auto-play
	* pcheckers-replay-games

In the future one script pcheckers may be installed that will include:

	* automatic AI game play (current script pcheckers-auto-play)
	* recorded game replay (current script pcheckers-replay-games)
	* interactive game play of 1 or 2 human players

If SDL perl modules are installed, then the SDL support is automatically
detected and activated that replaces the default terminal IO.
