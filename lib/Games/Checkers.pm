=head1 ABSTRACT

Games::Checkers is a set of Perl classes implementing the Checkers game
play. 17 different national rule variants (and any custom mix of rules)
are supported on any arbitrary board sizes. A basic AI heuristics is
implemented using the Minimax algorithm. Replay of previously recorded
games is supported too.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package is intended to provide complete infrastructure for interactive
and automatic playing and manipulating of Checkers games.

Currently supported checkers/draughts variants (AI and game replay):

	* russian
	* russian_give_away
	* russian_10x8 (spantsiretti)
	* international (polish)
	* english
	* english_give_away
	* italian
	* spanish
	* argentinian
	* portuguese
	* czech
	* german
	* thai
	* pool (american_pool)
	* brazilian
	* frisian
	* canadian
	* sri_lankian

Currently supported board sizes:

	* 4x4, 6x6, 8x10 (just for fun)
	* 8x8
	* 10x8
	* 10x10
	* 12x12
	* 14x14, 16x16 (not too practical)

Note that every variant configures its own board size, but it is made
possible to play using any variant rules on different board sizes too,
for example Russian Checkers on 12x12 board. Or even construct own
rule variants, like: Give-Away International Checkers on the 8x10 board
without the requirement to capture maximal amount of pieces.

Currently supported game file formats:

	* .pdn files (trying to detect a lot of broken notations too)
	* .pdn.gz|xz|bz2 files (automatically uncompressed on the fly)

Currently installed scripts:

	* pcheckers-auto-play
	* pcheckers-replay-games

In the future one script C<pcheckers> may be installed that will include:

	* automatic AI game play (current script pcheckers-auto-play)
	* recorded game replay (current script pcheckers-replay-games)
	* interactive game play of 1 or 2 human players

If SDL perl modules are installed, then the SDL support is automatically
detected and activated that replaces the default terminal IO.

=head1 The Rules of Checkers

=head2 Board

The regular checkerboard is comprised of 64 squares of contrasting colors,
like black and white. The checker pieces may be red and white in color (or
any combination of contrasting colors), usually grooved.

The black board squares are numbered either 1 to 32 or using the chess a1 to
h8 notation. The diagram below shows the pieces set up for play, with Black
occupying squares 1 to 12 (lines 6 to 8 in the chess notation) and White
occupying squares 21 to 32 (lines 1 to 3 in the chess notation).

Each player (White and Black) controls its own army of pieces. Pieces move
only on dark squares which are numbered. The white pieces always move first
in opening the game. For example, suppose White were to open the game by
moving the piece on 23 to the square marked 19, like shown above. This would
be recorded as 23-19. Or e3-f4 in the chess notation. Another possible
notation is ef4.

=head2 The goal

The goal in the checkers game is either to capture all of the opponent's
pieces or to blockade them. If neither player can accomplish the above, the
game is a draw.

=head2 Moves

Starting with White, the players take turns moving one of their own pieces.
A 'piece' means either a 'man' (other name is 'pawn') - an ordinary single
checker or a 'king' which is what a man becomes if it reaches the last rank
(see kings). A man may move one square diagonally only forward - that is,
toward the opponent - onto an empty square.

=head2 Captures

Checkers rules state that captures or 'jumps' are mandatory. If a square
diagonally in front of a man is occupied by an opponent's piece, and if the
square beyond that piece in the same direction is empty, the man may 'jump'
over the opponent's piece and land on the empty square. The opponent's piece
is captured and removed from the board.

In some variants, if in the course of single or multiple jumps the man
reaches the last rank, becoming a king, the turn shifts to the opponent;
no further 'continuation' jump is possible.

=head2 The kings

When a single piece reaches the last rank of the board by reason of a move,
or as the completion of a 'jump', it becomes a king; and that completes the
move, or 'jump'.

A king can move in any of the four diagonal directions and skip zero, one or
more empty cells, as the limits of the board permit. Similarly, the king can
optionally capture exactly one opponent piece at a time during such jump.

In some variants, a king has the same limits as a man (can't skip empty
cells), just moves and captures in 4 diagonal directions, as opposed to 2
forward directions.
